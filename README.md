# SHA256HashingFunction

Attached is a working SHA256 hashing function created for a personal project.  Input any value and it computes the hashed equivalent.  Any ASCII or unicode value works. 
Motivation was through a cryptography course and initially made no sense, but after this project it does now.

Output was compared to online SHA256 calculators and was done using thousands of different inputs (mainly from an existing rockyou.txt database,I got lazy but
the first hour of inputs resulted in correct values so im assuming it works as intended).  Eventually hope to make a GUI version that allows users to see the 
SHA256 hashing in action with hexed values in a readable and easy to follow format.
