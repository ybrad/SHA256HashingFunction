# SHA256HashingFunction

Attached is a working SHA256 hashing function created for a personal project.  Input any value and it computes the hashed equivalent.  Any ASCII or unicode value works. 
Motivation was through a cryptography course and initially made no sense, but after this project it does now.

Output was compared to online SHA256 calculators and was done using about a thousands of different inputs (mainly from an existing rockyou.txt database,I got lazy but
the first hour of inputs resulted in correct values so im assuming it works as intended).
